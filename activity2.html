  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    The hybrid renewable energy system integrates <strong>solar</strong> and <strong>wind</strong> technologies to supply
    continuous and clean power to a rural health clinic. The <strong>solar PV array</strong> converts sunlight to DC energy,
    while the <strong>wind turbine</strong> generates power from moving air. Both sources are managed by a
    <strong>hybrid charge controller</strong> that optimizes charging of the <strong>battery bank</strong>. The stored energy is
    converted into AC through an <strong>inverter</strong> and used for medical loads, lights, and refrigeration.
    A <strong>backup generator</strong> ensures reliability during extended low-resource conditions. This hybrid system enhances
    energy resilience, reduces diesel dependency, and promotes sustainable healthcare in off-grid areas.
