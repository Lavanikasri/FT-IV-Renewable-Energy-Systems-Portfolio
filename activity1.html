  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    A rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system uses <strong>solar energy</strong> as its renewable source.
    The PV panels convert sunlight into <strong>direct current (DC)</strong> electricity through the photovoltaic effect.
    The generated DC is regulated by a <strong>charge controller</strong> that safely charges the <strong>battery bank</strong>,
    which stores energy for nighttime use. The stored power or direct solar output is converted to
    <strong>alternating current (AC)</strong> using an inverter, making it suitable for domestic loads.
    The system also includes a <strong>grid connection</strong> that allows two-way power flow—exporting excess power
    to the grid and importing power when solar energy is insufficient. This 5 kW setup supports a household’s energy
    demand, reduces electricity costs, and promotes sustainable energy independence.
