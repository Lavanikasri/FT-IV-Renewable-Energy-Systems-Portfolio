  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    The solar-powered irrigation pumping system harnesses <strong>solar radiation</strong> to extract water for farming.
    The <strong>solar PV array</strong> converts sunlight into DC electricity, optimized through an
    <strong>MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) controller</strong> to ensure efficient energy transfer.
    This powers a <strong>submersible pump</strong> that draws water from a borewell and directs it to a
    <strong>storage tank</strong> or irrigation field. The system operates off-grid, removing the need for diesel or
    grid-based electricity, making it sustainable and cost-effective. It supports eco-friendly agriculture, improves
    irrigation reliability, and contributes to rural energy independence.
